abstract = {The widespread use of rare earth elements (REEs) in numerous sectors have resulted in their release into the environment. Existing knowledge about the effects of REEs were acquired mainly based on toxicity tests with aquatic organisms and a fixed exposure time, Here, the dynamic accumulation and toxicity of REEs (La, Ce, and Gd) in soil organism Enchytraeus crypticus were determined and modeled by a first-order one-compartment model and a time-toxicity logistic model, respectively. Generally, the accumulation and toxicity of REEs were both exposure level- and time-dependent. The overall uptake rate constants were 2.97, 2.48, and 2.38 L kg−1d−1 for La, Ce, and Gd, respectively. The corresponding elimination rate constants were 0.99, 0.78, and 0.56 d−1, respectively. The worms exhibited faster uptake and elimination ability for light REEs (La and Ce) than for heavy REEs (Gd). For all three REEs, the LC50 values based on exposure concentrations decreased with time and reached ultimate values after approximately 10 d exposure. The estimated ultimate LC50 values (LC50∞) were 279, 334, and 358 mg L−1 for Ce, Gd, and La, respectively. When expressed as body concentration, the LC50inter value was almost constant with time, demonstrating that internal body concentration could be a better indicator of dynamic toxicity of REEs than external dose. This study highlights that specific REE and exposure time should be taken into account in accurately assessing risk of REEs.}

@article{Lo2015,
abstract = {To improve current bioaccumulation assessment methods, a methodology is developed, applied, and investigated for measuring in vivo biotransformation rates of hydrophobic organic substances in the body (soma) and gastrointestinal tract of the fish. The method resembles the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 305 dietary bioaccumulation test but includes reference chemicals to determine both somatic and gastrointestinal biotransformation rates of test chemicals. Somatic biotransformation rate constants for the test chemicals ranged between 0 d-1 and 0.38 (standard error [SE] 0.03)/d-1. Gastrointestinal biotransformation rate constants varied from 0 d-1 to 46 (SE 7) d-1. Gastrointestinal biotransformation contributed more to the overall biotransformation in fish than somatic biotransformation for all test substances but 1. Results suggest that biomagnification tests can reveal the full extent of biotransformation in fish. The common presumption that the liver is the main site of biotransformation may not apply to many substances exposed through the diet. The results suggest that the application of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) for somatic biotransformation rates and hepatic in vitro models to assess the effect of biotransformation on bioaccumulation can underestimate biotransformation rates and overestimate the biomagnification potential of chemicals that are biotransformed in the gastrointestinal tract. With some modifications, the OECD 305 test can generate somatic and gastrointestinal biotransformation data to develop biotransformation QSARs and test in vitro-in vivo biotransformation extrapolation methods.},

@article{Eichinger2010,
abstract = {Experiments were performed on juvenile sole in controlled conditions in the aim of understanding how the biology of common sole may affect the accumulation and dilution of Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The fish were raised in optimal conditions and divided into two tanks: one control tank and one PCB tank. 4 PCB congeners were added to food for 3. months in the PCB tank; the soles were subsequently fed unspiked food for 3. months. Growth (length and weight) and PCB concentrations were monitored in both tanks and juvenile sole growth was not significantly affected by PCBs in our experimental conditions. We used the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory to model sole biology and paid special attention to model calibration through the wide use of data from the literature. The model accurately reproduced fish growth in both tanks. We coupled a bioaccumulation model to reproduce the concentration dynamics of the 4 PCB congeners used. This model did not require additional calibration and was dependent solely on the growth model and PCB concentrations in food. The bioaccumulation model accurately simulated PCB accumulation in fish, but overestimated PCB concentrations in fish during the dilution phase. This may suggest that in addition to PCB dilution due to growth, PCB concentrations decreased due to other PCB elimination mechanisms. Finally, we discussed potential improvements to the model and its future applications. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Svobodova2018,
abstract = {Agriculture is today indispensably connected with enormous use of pesticides. Despite tough regulation, their entrance into soil cannot be excluded and they might enter soil organisms and plants and continue further to terrestrial food chains. This study was conducted to investigate the bioaccumulation of two pesticides currently used in large amounts, the insecticide chlorpyrifos (CLP) and the fungicide tebuconazole (TBZ). Their detailed uptake kinetics in the model earthworm species Eisenia andrei were measured in two arable soils differing in organic carbon content (1.02 and 1.93{\%} respectively). According to our results, a steady state was reached after 3–5 days for both pesticides and soils. The values of bioaccumulation factors calculated at the steady state ranged from 4.5 to 6.3 for CLP and 2.2–13.1 for TBZ. Bioaccumulation factors were also calculated as the ratio of uptake and elimination rate constants with results comparable with steady-state bioaccumulation factors. The results suggested that the degradation and bioaccumulation of tested compounds might be influenced by other factors than only total organic carbon (e.g. clay content). The lower Koc and hydrophobicity of TBZ relative to CLP probably led to higher availability of TBZ through pore water exposure. On the other hand, CLP's higher hydrophobicity probably caused an increase in availability by its additional uptake via ingestion. To enable a proper ecological risk assessment of current pesticides in soils, it is necessary to accurately determine their bioaccumulation in soil invertebrates. We believe that our study not only brings such information for two specific pesticides but also addresses key methodological issues in this area. Five-day exposure of E. andrei to chlorpyrifos and tebuconazole in arable soils is sufficient to reach steady state and the uptake kinetics are influenced by the Kow of compounds and soil TOC and clay contents.},

abstract = {The feasibility of a bioaccumulation test based on the use of zebrafish eleutheroembryos as an alternative to adult-individual-based approaches for REACH application has been evaluated for three test compounds, chlorpyrifos, dicofol and atrazine. Following the OECD 305 guidelines, zebrafish eleutheroembryos (72h after hatching, hpf) were separately exposed to the investigated pesticides at two nominal concentrations below 1{\%} of its corresponding LC50. The uptake experiments lasted for 48h. Then, the exposure medium was replaced by a non-contaminated medium for depuration experiments (up to 72h). Zebrafish eleutheroembryos (larvae 144 hpf, i.e. at the end of the depuration step) and their corresponding exposure media was sampled at ten different times during each experiment and the concentration of the investigated pesticide determined in both the organisms and in the exposure medium. The experimentally determined pesticide accumulation profiles in the eleutheroembryos demonstrated that atrazine has a very fast accumulation kinetic, reaching steady sate (SS) within 24h. Chlorpyrifos and dicofol did not reach the SS within the 48-h uptake experiments although they exhibit higher accumulations than the former pesticide. Two toxicokinetic models were used to calculate the bioconcentration factor (BCF) of the studied pesticide in zebrafish eleutheroembryos. In the former, the BCF was calculated under SS conditions (BCFSS). The second was used when the compounds did not reach the SS during the uptake experiment (BCFk). Log BCF values of 3.55 and 3.84 for chlorpyrifos; 0.6 and 1.17 for atrazine, and 3.90 for dicofol were experimentally calculated at selected exposure concentrations. These values have been compared with those reported in related bioaccumulation studies and official databases. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Kretschmann2011,
abstract = {A toxicokinetic model for Daphnia magna, which simulates the internal concentration of the insecticide diazinon, its detoxification product 2-isopropyl-6-methyl-4-pyrimidinol, and its active metabolite diazoxon, is presented. During in vivo exposure to diazinon with and without inhibition of cytochrome P450 by piperonyl butoxide, the parent compound as well as its metabolites were quantified with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in extracts of D. magna. Rate constants of all relevant toxicokinetic steps were obtained by modeling the time course of the internal concentrations with a multicomponent first-order kinetics model. When cytochrome P450 was inhibited, the kinetic bioconcentration factor (BCF) of diazinon increased from 17.8 to 51.0 mL{\textperiodcentered}gww-1. This clearly indicates that diazinon is biotransformed to a high degree by cytochrome P450 in D. magna. The dominant elimination step of diazinon was shown to be its oxidative dearylation to pyrimidinol (62{\%} of total elimination) with a corresponding rate constant of 0.16 h-1. In contrast, oxidative activation to diazoxon with a rate constant of 0.02 h-1 amounted to only 8{\%} of the total elimination. During exposure to diazinon, the active metabolite diazoxon could be detected only in very low concentrations (approximately 0.5{\%} of the parent compound), presumably due to a very fast reaction with the target site acetylcholinesterase. During the exposure experiments (no feeding of daphnids), an exponential decline of the lipid content in D. magna with a first-order rate constant of 0.013 h-1 was observed. For short exposure times (≥24 h), this had only a minor influence on the determined TK parameters. Such a TK model containing detailed biotransformation processes is an important tool for estimation of the toxic potential of chemicals, particularly, when active metabolites are formed inside an organism. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Kinetic parameters (uptake from solution and elimination rate constants) of Cu, Ni and Pb bioaccumulation were determined from two Gammarus pulex and three Gammarus fossrum wild populations collected from reference sites throughout France in order to assess the inter-species and the natural inter-population variability of metal bioaccumulation kinetics in that sentinel organism. For that, each population was independently exposed for seven days to either 2.5μgL−1 Cu (39.3nM), 40μgL−1 Ni (681nM) or 10μgL−1 Pb (48.3nM) in laboratory controlled conditions, and then placed in unexposed microcosms for a 7-day depuration period. In the same way, the possible influence of metal exposure history on subsequent metal bioaccumulation kinetics was addressed by collecting wild gammarids from three populations inhabiting stations contaminated either by Cd, Pb or both Pb and Ni (named pre-exposed thereafter). In these pre-exposed organisms, assessment of any changes in metal bioaccumulation kinetics was achieved by comparison with the natural variability of kinetic parameters defined from reference populations. Results showed that in all studied populations (reference and pre-exposed) no significant Cu bioaccumulation was observed at the exposure concentration of 2.5μgL−1. Concerning the reference populations, no significant differences in Ni and Pb bioaccumulation kinetics between the two species (G. pulex and G. fossarum) was observed allowing us to consider all the five reference populations to determine the inter-population natural variability, which was found to be relatively low (kinetic parameters determined for each population remained within a factor of 2 of the minimum and maximum values). Organisms from the population exhibiting a Pb exposure history presented reduced Ni uptake and elimination rate constants, whereas no influence on Ni kinetic parameters was observed in organisms from the population exhibiting an exposure history to both Ni and Pb. Furthermore Pb bioaccumulation kinetics were unaffected whatever the condition of pre-exposure in natural environment. Finally, these results highlight the complexity of confounding factors, such as metal exposure history, that influence metal bioaccumulation processes and showed that pre-exposure to one metal can cause changes in the bioaccumulation kinetics of other metals. These results also address the question of the underlying mechanisms developed by organisms to cope with metal contamination.}

abstract = {Pyrethroids are highly toxic towards aquatic macroinvertebrates such as Daphnia magna and can be synergized when co-occurring with azole fungicides. A sensitive analytical method for the measurement of azole-pyrethroid mixtures in aquatic macroinvertebrates is not available at present. We developed and validated an extraction, cleanup, and quantification procedure for four pyrethroid insecticides and four azole fungicides at the picograms per milligram wet weight level in D. magna using a QuEChERS approach and GC-ECD analysis. Short- and long-term matrix effects were analyzed by injection of a series of extracts from D. magna, and the best surrogate standards were identified through correlation analysis of analyte responses. The presence of matrix clearly stabilized the analyte responses (≤6 % relative standard deviation of peak area compared to up to 22 % when injected without matrix). The sensitivity was high with detection limits and limits of quantification between 58–168 and 119–571 pg mg(wet weight)−1 for the azoles and 5.8–27 and 12–84 pg mg(wet weight)−1 for the pyrethroids, respectively. Accuracy (% recovery) was between 95 and 111 % and the precision (repeatability) below 10 % relative standard deviation for all analytes. In the case of prochloraz, $\alpha$-cypermethrin, and deltamethrin, normalization to surrogate standards led to a clear improvement of accuracy and precision by up to 8 and 4 %, respectively. The method was successfully applied to the measurement of internal $\alpha$-cypermethrin concentrations in D. magna under environmentally relevant exposure conditions (exposure to a pulse in the micrograms per liter range) with and without co-exposure to propiconazole.},

abstract = {Carbamate insecticides such as carbaryl and organophosphates such as azinphos-methyl share the ability to inhibit the activity of B-esterases. This study aimed to (1) assess the inhibitory effects of carbaryl on B-esterase activity in soft tissues and hemolymph of Planorbarius corneus; (2) establish whether binary mixtures of carbaryl and azinphos-methyl depart or not from a model of concentration addition on the inhibition of cholinesterase activity; (3) determine the bioconcentration and elimination of the pesticides. The results showed that exposure of gastropods to increasing concentrations of carbaryl (0.1–5 mg L−1) for 48 h inhibited cholinesterase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, with an EC50 of 1.4 ± 0.3 mg L−1 and 1.2 ± 0.1 mg L−1 for soft tissue and hemolymph, respectively. Carboxylesterase activity, measured with the substrates p-nitrophenyl butyrate and p-nitrophenyl acetate, was between 2.3 and 25 times more sensitive to carbaryl inhibition than cholinesterase activity. Binary mixtures corresponding to 0.5 EC50 carbaryl + 0.5 EC50 azinphos-methyl and 0.75 EC50 carbaryl + 0.75 EC50 azinphos-methyl produced inhibitions of cholinesterase activity similar to those of individual pesticides, following a model of concentration addition. Bioconcentration was analyzed using a one-compartment model. The absorption kinetics (k1) for both pesticides alone (1.4 mg L−1 of carbaryl or 1.8 mg L−1 of azinphos-methyl) or mixed (1.4 mg L−1 of carbaryl + 1.8 mg L−1 of azinphos-methyl) were similar. The elimination kinetics ratio (k2) estimated for the pesticides alone or in the mixtures showed that carbaryl was eliminated 3.5 times faster than azinphos-methyl. These results suggest that exposure of Planorbarius corneus to binary mixtures of carbaryl and azinphos-methyl for 48 h follow a concentration addition model on inhibition of cholinesterase activity and that the pesticide mixtures do not change the toxicokinetic parameters of the parent compounds.}

The derived BCFs for these pharmaceuticals did not trigger any regulatory thresholds and ranged from 0 to 73 L kg−1 (sulfamethazine showed no bioconcentration). Metabolism of chemicals can affect accurate BCF determination through parameterisation of the kinetic models. The added selectivity of LC-MS/MS allowed us to develop confirmatory methods to monitor the biotransformation of propranolol, carbamazepine and diazepam in G. pulex. Varying concentrations of the biotransformed products; 4-hydroxypropranolol sulphate, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, nordiazepam, oxazepam and temazepam were measured following exposure of the precursor compounds. For diazepam, the biotransformation product nordiazepam was present at higher concentrations than the parent compound at 94 ng g−1 dw. Overall, the results indicate that pharmaceutical accumulation is low in these freshwater amphipods, which can potentially be explained by the rapid biotransformation and excretion.}

abstract = {The influence of temperature on the bioaccumulation, toxicokinetics, biotransformation and depuration of pyrene was studied in the arctic marine amphipod Gammarus setosus. A two-compartment model was used to fit experimental values of total body burden, total metabolites and parent pyrene concentrations and to calculate toxicokinetic variables derived for two experimental treatments (2 and 8 °C). No statistically significant differences were observed with temperature for these toxicokinetic variables or bioconcentration factors. Contrarily, the Q10 values suggested that the toxicokinetic variables ke and km were temperature-dependent. This may be explained by the high standard deviation of the Q10 values. Q10 is the variation in the rate of a metabolic reaction with a 10 °C increase in temperature. Depuration rate constants were calculated from linear best fit equations applied to measured pyrene concentrations over time during the depuration phase of the experiment. During depuration, the parent pyrene was eliminated in two stages with faster elimination observed at 8 °C compared to 2 °C. This finding was also indicated by the Q10. No changes in total body burdens of metabolite concentrations were observed during the monitoring of depuration over a period of 96 h. The biotransformation pathway of pyrene in G. setosus was also investigated in this study with two main phase II biotransformation products discovered by liquid chromatography. These products are conditionally identified as the sulphate and glucose conjugates of 1-hydroxy-pyrene. Overall, the study contributes new knowledge to the understanding of the fate of PAHs in arctic biota. In particular, the study provides valuable insight into the bioaccumulation and biotransformation of an important PAH and its metabolites in a species that serves as both a predator and prey in the arctic ecosystem.}

abstract = {Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) may reach the soil compartment via sewage sludge or nanoagrochemical applications. Understanding how NPs interact with biological systems is crucial for an accurate hazard assessment. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the Ag toxicokinetics in the mealworm Tenebrio molitor, exposed via Lufa 2.2 soil or via food to different Ag forms (uncoated 50 nm AgNPs, paraffin coated 3-8 nm and PVP-stabilised 60 nm, Ag2S NPs 20 nm, and ionic Ag). Mealworms were exposed for 21 days followed by a 21-day elimination phase (clean soil/food). A one-compartment kinetics model with inert fraction (simulating a storage compartment, where detoxified forms are located) was used to describe Ag accumulation. Fully understanding the uptake route in mealworms is difficult. For that reason several approaches were used, showing that food, soil and pore water all are valid uptake routes, but with different importance. Silver taken up from soil pore water or from soil showed to be related to Ag dissolution in soil pore water. In general, the uptake and elimination rate constants were similar for 3-8 nm and 60 nm AgNPs and for AgNO3, but significantly different for the uncoated 50 nm AgNPs. Upon food exposure, uptake rate constants were similar for 50 nm AgNPs and AgNO3, while those for 60 nm and 3-8 nm AgNPs and for Ag2S NPs also grouped together. NP exposure in soil appeared more difficult to characterize, with different patterns obtained for the different NPs. But it was evident that upon soil or food exposure, particle characteristics highly affected Ag bioavailability and bioaccumulation. Although Ag2S NPs were taken up, their elimination was faster than for other Ag forms, showing the lowest inert fraction. The significantly different elimination rate constants suggest that the mechanism of elimination may not be the same for different AgNPs either.}
