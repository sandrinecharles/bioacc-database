abstract = {The widespread use of rare earth elements (REEs) in numerous sectors have resulted in their release into the environment. Existing knowledge about the effects of REEs were acquired mainly based on toxicity tests with aquatic organisms and a fixed exposure time, Here, the dynamic accumulation and toxicity of REEs (La, Ce, and Gd) in soil organism Enchytraeus crypticus were determined and modeled by a first-order one-compartment model and a time-toxicity logistic model, respectively. Generally, the accumulation and toxicity of REEs were both exposure level- and time-dependent. The overall uptake rate constants were 2.97, 2.48, and 2.38 L kg−1d−1 for La, Ce, and Gd, respectively. The corresponding elimination rate constants were 0.99, 0.78, and 0.56 d−1, respectively. The worms exhibited faster uptake and elimination ability for light REEs (La and Ce) than for heavy REEs (Gd). For all three REEs, the LC50 values based on exposure concentrations decreased with time and reached ultimate values after approximately 10 d exposure. The estimated ultimate LC50 values (LC50∞) were 279, 334, and 358 mg L−1 for Ce, Gd, and La, respectively. When expressed as body concentration, the LC50inter value was almost constant with time, demonstrating that internal body concentration could be a better indicator of dynamic toxicity of REEs than external dose. This study highlights that specific REE and exposure time should be taken into account in accurately assessing risk of REEs.}

@article{Lo2015,
abstract = {To improve current bioaccumulation assessment methods, a methodology is developed, applied, and investigated for measuring in vivo biotransformation rates of hydrophobic organic substances in the body (soma) and gastrointestinal tract of the fish. The method resembles the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 305 dietary bioaccumulation test but includes reference chemicals to determine both somatic and gastrointestinal biotransformation rates of test chemicals. Somatic biotransformation rate constants for the test chemicals ranged between 0 d-1 and 0.38 (standard error [SE] 0.03)/d-1. Gastrointestinal biotransformation rate constants varied from 0 d-1 to 46 (SE 7) d-1. Gastrointestinal biotransformation contributed more to the overall biotransformation in fish than somatic biotransformation for all test substances but 1. Results suggest that biomagnification tests can reveal the full extent of biotransformation in fish. The common presumption that the liver is the main site of biotransformation may not apply to many substances exposed through the diet. The results suggest that the application of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) for somatic biotransformation rates and hepatic in vitro models to assess the effect of biotransformation on bioaccumulation can underestimate biotransformation rates and overestimate the biomagnification potential of chemicals that are biotransformed in the gastrointestinal tract. With some modifications, the OECD 305 test can generate somatic and gastrointestinal biotransformation data to develop biotransformation QSARs and test in vitro-in vivo biotransformation extrapolation methods.},

@article{Eichinger2010,
abstract = {Experiments were performed on juvenile sole in controlled conditions in the aim of understanding how the biology of common sole may affect the accumulation and dilution of Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The fish were raised in optimal conditions and divided into two tanks: one control tank and one PCB tank. 4 PCB congeners were added to food for 3. months in the PCB tank; the soles were subsequently fed unspiked food for 3. months. Growth (length and weight) and PCB concentrations were monitored in both tanks and juvenile sole growth was not significantly affected by PCBs in our experimental conditions. We used the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory to model sole biology and paid special attention to model calibration through the wide use of data from the literature. The model accurately reproduced fish growth in both tanks. We coupled a bioaccumulation model to reproduce the concentration dynamics of the 4 PCB congeners used. This model did not require additional calibration and was dependent solely on the growth model and PCB concentrations in food. The bioaccumulation model accurately simulated PCB accumulation in fish, but overestimated PCB concentrations in fish during the dilution phase. This may suggest that in addition to PCB dilution due to growth, PCB concentrations decreased due to other PCB elimination mechanisms. Finally, we discussed potential improvements to the model and its future applications. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Svobodova2018,
abstract = {Agriculture is today indispensably connected with enormous use of pesticides. Despite tough regulation, their entrance into soil cannot be excluded and they might enter soil organisms and plants and continue further to terrestrial food chains. This study was conducted to investigate the bioaccumulation of two pesticides currently used in large amounts, the insecticide chlorpyrifos (CLP) and the fungicide tebuconazole (TBZ). Their detailed uptake kinetics in the model earthworm species Eisenia andrei were measured in two arable soils differing in organic carbon content (1.02 and 1.93{\%} respectively). According to our results, a steady state was reached after 3–5 days for both pesticides and soils. The values of bioaccumulation factors calculated at the steady state ranged from 4.5 to 6.3 for CLP and 2.2–13.1 for TBZ. Bioaccumulation factors were also calculated as the ratio of uptake and elimination rate constants with results comparable with steady-state bioaccumulation factors. The results suggested that the degradation and bioaccumulation of tested compounds might be influenced by other factors than only total organic carbon (e.g. clay content). The lower Koc and hydrophobicity of TBZ relative to CLP probably led to higher availability of TBZ through pore water exposure. On the other hand, CLP's higher hydrophobicity probably caused an increase in availability by its additional uptake via ingestion. To enable a proper ecological risk assessment of current pesticides in soils, it is necessary to accurately determine their bioaccumulation in soil invertebrates. We believe that our study not only brings such information for two specific pesticides but also addresses key methodological issues in this area. Five-day exposure of E. andrei to chlorpyrifos and tebuconazole in arable soils is sufficient to reach steady state and the uptake kinetics are influenced by the Kow of compounds and soil TOC and clay contents.},

abstract = {The feasibility of a bioaccumulation test based on the use of zebrafish eleutheroembryos as an alternative to adult-individual-based approaches for REACH application has been evaluated for three test compounds, chlorpyrifos, dicofol and atrazine. Following the OECD 305 guidelines, zebrafish eleutheroembryos (72h after hatching, hpf) were separately exposed to the investigated pesticides at two nominal concentrations below 1{\%} of its corresponding LC50. The uptake experiments lasted for 48h. Then, the exposure medium was replaced by a non-contaminated medium for depuration experiments (up to 72h). Zebrafish eleutheroembryos (larvae 144 hpf, i.e. at the end of the depuration step) and their corresponding exposure media was sampled at ten different times during each experiment and the concentration of the investigated pesticide determined in both the organisms and in the exposure medium. The experimentally determined pesticide accumulation profiles in the eleutheroembryos demonstrated that atrazine has a very fast accumulation kinetic, reaching steady sate (SS) within 24h. Chlorpyrifos and dicofol did not reach the SS within the 48-h uptake experiments although they exhibit higher accumulations than the former pesticide. Two toxicokinetic models were used to calculate the bioconcentration factor (BCF) of the studied pesticide in zebrafish eleutheroembryos. In the former, the BCF was calculated under SS conditions (BCFSS). The second was used when the compounds did not reach the SS during the uptake experiment (BCFk). Log BCF values of 3.55 and 3.84 for chlorpyrifos; 0.6 and 1.17 for atrazine, and 3.90 for dicofol were experimentally calculated at selected exposure concentrations. These values have been compared with those reported in related bioaccumulation studies and official databases. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Kretschmann2011,
abstract = {A toxicokinetic model for Daphnia magna, which simulates the internal concentration of the insecticide diazinon, its detoxification product 2-isopropyl-6-methyl-4-pyrimidinol, and its active metabolite diazoxon, is presented. During in vivo exposure to diazinon with and without inhibition of cytochrome P450 by piperonyl butoxide, the parent compound as well as its metabolites were quantified with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in extracts of D. magna. Rate constants of all relevant toxicokinetic steps were obtained by modeling the time course of the internal concentrations with a multicomponent first-order kinetics model. When cytochrome P450 was inhibited, the kinetic bioconcentration factor (BCF) of diazinon increased from 17.8 to 51.0 mL{\textperiodcentered}gww-1. This clearly indicates that diazinon is biotransformed to a high degree by cytochrome P450 in D. magna. The dominant elimination step of diazinon was shown to be its oxidative dearylation to pyrimidinol (62{\%} of total elimination) with a corresponding rate constant of 0.16 h-1. In contrast, oxidative activation to diazoxon with a rate constant of 0.02 h-1 amounted to only 8{\%} of the total elimination. During exposure to diazinon, the active metabolite diazoxon could be detected only in very low concentrations (approximately 0.5{\%} of the parent compound), presumably due to a very fast reaction with the target site acetylcholinesterase. During the exposure experiments (no feeding of daphnids), an exponential decline of the lipid content in D. magna with a first-order rate constant of 0.013 h-1 was observed. For short exposure times (≥24 h), this had only a minor influence on the determined TK parameters. Such a TK model containing detailed biotransformation processes is an important tool for estimation of the toxic potential of chemicals, particularly, when active metabolites are formed inside an organism. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Kinetic parameters (uptake from solution and elimination rate constants) of Cu, Ni and Pb bioaccumulation were determined from two Gammarus pulex and three Gammarus fossrum wild populations collected from reference sites throughout France in order to assess the inter-species and the natural inter-population variability of metal bioaccumulation kinetics in that sentinel organism. For that, each population was independently exposed for seven days to either 2.5μgL−1 Cu (39.3nM), 40μgL−1 Ni (681nM) or 10μgL−1 Pb (48.3nM) in laboratory controlled conditions, and then placed in unexposed microcosms for a 7-day depuration period. In the same way, the possible influence of metal exposure history on subsequent metal bioaccumulation kinetics was addressed by collecting wild gammarids from three populations inhabiting stations contaminated either by Cd, Pb or both Pb and Ni (named pre-exposed thereafter). In these pre-exposed organisms, assessment of any changes in metal bioaccumulation kinetics was achieved by comparison with the natural variability of kinetic parameters defined from reference populations. Results showed that in all studied populations (reference and pre-exposed) no significant Cu bioaccumulation was observed at the exposure concentration of 2.5μgL−1. Concerning the reference populations, no significant differences in Ni and Pb bioaccumulation kinetics between the two species (G. pulex and G. fossarum) was observed allowing us to consider all the five reference populations to determine the inter-population natural variability, which was found to be relatively low (kinetic parameters determined for each population remained within a factor of 2 of the minimum and maximum values). Organisms from the population exhibiting a Pb exposure history presented reduced Ni uptake and elimination rate constants, whereas no influence on Ni kinetic parameters was observed in organisms from the population exhibiting an exposure history to both Ni and Pb. Furthermore Pb bioaccumulation kinetics were unaffected whatever the condition of pre-exposure in natural environment. Finally, these results highlight the complexity of confounding factors, such as metal exposure history, that influence metal bioaccumulation processes and showed that pre-exposure to one metal can cause changes in the bioaccumulation kinetics of other metals. These results also address the question of the underlying mechanisms developed by organisms to cope with metal contamination.}

abstract = {Pyrethroids are highly toxic towards aquatic macroinvertebrates such as Daphnia magna and can be synergized when co-occurring with azole fungicides. A sensitive analytical method for the measurement of azole-pyrethroid mixtures in aquatic macroinvertebrates is not available at present. We developed and validated an extraction, cleanup, and quantification procedure for four pyrethroid insecticides and four azole fungicides at the picograms per milligram wet weight level in D. magna using a QuEChERS approach and GC-ECD analysis. Short- and long-term matrix effects were analyzed by injection of a series of extracts from D. magna, and the best surrogate standards were identified through correlation analysis of analyte responses. The presence of matrix clearly stabilized the analyte responses (≤6 % relative standard deviation of peak area compared to up to 22 % when injected without matrix). The sensitivity was high with detection limits and limits of quantification between 58–168 and 119–571 pg mg(wet weight)−1 for the azoles and 5.8–27 and 12–84 pg mg(wet weight)−1 for the pyrethroids, respectively. Accuracy (% recovery) was between 95 and 111 % and the precision (repeatability) below 10 % relative standard deviation for all analytes. In the case of prochloraz, $\alpha$-cypermethrin, and deltamethrin, normalization to surrogate standards led to a clear improvement of accuracy and precision by up to 8 and 4 %, respectively. The method was successfully applied to the measurement of internal $\alpha$-cypermethrin concentrations in D. magna under environmentally relevant exposure conditions (exposure to a pulse in the micrograms per liter range) with and without co-exposure to propiconazole.},

This study aimed to (1) assess the inhibitory effects of carbaryl on B-esterase activity in soft tissues and hemolymph of Planorbarius corneus; (2) establish whether binary mixtures of carbaryl and azinphos-methyl depart or not from a model of concentration addition on the inhibition of cholinesterase activity; (3) determine the bioconcentration and elimination of the pesticides. The results showed that exposure of gastropods to increasing concentrations of carbaryl (0.1–5 mg L−1) for 48 h inhibited cholinesterase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, with an EC50 of 1.4 ± 0.3 mg L−1 and 1.2 ± 0.1 mg L−1 for soft tissue and hemolymph, respectively. Carboxylesterase activity, measured with the substrates p-nitrophenyl butyrate and p-nitrophenyl acetate, was between 2.3 and 25 times more sensitive to carbaryl inhibition than cholinesterase activity. Binary mixtures corresponding to 0.5 EC50 carbaryl + 0.5 EC50 azinphos-methyl and 0.75 EC50 carbaryl + 0.75 EC50 azinphos-methyl produced inhibitions of cholinesterase activity similar to those of individual pesticides, following a model of concentration addition. Bioconcentration was analyzed using a one-compartment model. The absorption kinetics (k1) for both pesticides alone (1.4 mg L−1 of carbaryl or 1.8 mg L−1 of azinphos-methyl) or mixed (1.4 mg L−1 of carbaryl + 1.8 mg L−1 of azinphos-methyl) were similar. The elimination kinetics ratio (k2) estimated for the pesticides alone or in the mixtures showed that carbaryl was eliminated 3.5 times faster than azinphos-methyl. These results suggest that exposure of Planorbarius corneus to binary mixtures of carbaryl and azinphos-methyl for 48 h follow a concentration addition model on inhibition of cholinesterase activity and that the pesticide mixtures do not change the toxicokinetic parameters of the parent compounds.}

The derived BCFs for these pharmaceuticals did not trigger any regulatory thresholds and ranged from 0 to 73 L kg−1 (sulfamethazine showed no bioconcentration). Metabolism of chemicals can affect accurate BCF determination through parameterisation of the kinetic models. The added selectivity of LC-MS/MS allowed us to develop confirmatory methods to monitor the biotransformation of propranolol, carbamazepine and diazepam in G. pulex. Varying concentrations of the biotransformed products; 4-hydroxypropranolol sulphate, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, nordiazepam, oxazepam and temazepam were measured following exposure of the precursor compounds. For diazepam, the biotransformation product nordiazepam was present at higher concentrations than the parent compound at 94 ng g−1 dw. Overall, the results indicate that pharmaceutical accumulation is low in these freshwater amphipods, which can potentially be explained by the rapid biotransformation and excretion.}

A two-compartment model was used to fit experimental values of total body burden, total metabolites and parent pyrene concentrations and to calculate toxicokinetic variables derived for two experimental treatments (2 and 8 °C). No statistically significant differences were observed with temperature for these toxicokinetic variables or bioconcentration factors. Contrarily, the Q10 values suggested that the toxicokinetic variables ke and km were temperature-dependent. This may be explained by the high standard deviation of the Q10 values. Q10 is the variation in the rate of a metabolic reaction with a 10 °C increase in temperature. Depuration rate constants were calculated from linear best fit equations applied to measured pyrene concentrations over time during the depuration phase of the experiment. During depuration, the parent pyrene was eliminated in two stages with faster elimination observed at 8 °C compared to 2 °C. This finding was also indicated by the Q10. No changes in total body burdens of metabolite concentrations were observed during the monitoring of depuration over a period of 96 h. The biotransformation pathway of pyrene in G. setosus was also investigated in this study with two main phase II biotransformation products discovered by liquid chromatography. These products are conditionally identified as the sulphate and glucose conjugates of 1-hydroxy-pyrene. Overall, the study contributes new knowledge to the understanding of the fate of PAHs in arctic biota. In particular, the study provides valuable insight into the bioaccumulation and biotransformation of an important PAH and its metabolites in a species that serves as both a predator and prey in the arctic ecosystem.}

Understanding how NPs interact with biological systems is crucial for an accurate hazard assessment. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the Ag toxicokinetics in the mealworm Tenebrio molitor, exposed via Lufa 2.2 soil or via food to different Ag forms (uncoated 50 nm AgNPs, paraffin coated 3-8 nm and PVP-stabilised 60 nm, Ag2S NPs 20 nm, and ionic Ag). Mealworms were exposed for 21 days followed by a 21-day elimination phase (clean soil/food). A one-compartment kinetics model with inert fraction (simulating a storage compartment, where detoxified forms are located) was used to describe Ag accumulation. Fully understanding the uptake route in mealworms is difficult. For that reason several approaches were used, showing that food, soil and pore water all are valid uptake routes, but with different importance. Silver taken up from soil pore water or from soil showed to be related to Ag dissolution in soil pore water. In general, the uptake and elimination rate constants were similar for 3-8 nm and 60 nm AgNPs and for AgNO3, but significantly different for the uncoated 50 nm AgNPs. Upon food exposure, uptake rate constants were similar for 50 nm AgNPs and AgNO3, while those for 60 nm and 3-8 nm AgNPs and for Ag2S NPs also grouped together. NP exposure in soil appeared more difficult to characterize, with different patterns obtained for the different NPs. But it was evident that upon soil or food exposure, particle characteristics highly affected Ag bioavailability and bioaccumulation. Although Ag2S NPs were taken up, their elimination was faster than for other Ag forms, showing the lowest inert fraction. The significantly different elimination rate constants suggest that the mechanism of elimination may not be the same for different AgNPs either.}

The present study is the first report on the accumulation and elimination of 8:2 diPAP in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis). The tissue-specific accumulation and depuration of 8:2 diPAP and its metabolites were investigated via semistatic seawater exposure (8:2 diPAP at a nominal concentration of 10?????g/L), through water-borne exposure with static daily renewal over a 72-h exposure period and a 360-h depuration period. The digestive gland was found to be the target organ where accumulation and biotransformation primarily occur. The bioaccumulation factor values (mL/g dry wt) in different organs were in the following order: digestive gland (1249) > adductor muscle (315) > gills (289) > gonad (82.9) > mantle (33.0). Moreover, the distribution of 8:2 diPAP among tissues may be related to the total protein content. The 8:2 diPAP tended to be excreted in feces. The compounds 8:2 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid, 8:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acid, 7:3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid, perfluorooctanoic acid, and perfluoroheptanoic acid were detected and quantified as phase I metabolites, and the concentration of all phase I metabolites relative to the 8:2 diPAP concentration (72???h) was 0.304???mol\%. A phase II metabolite, 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol conjugated with sulfate, was detected but not quantitated in the digestive gland. A biotransformation pathway of 8:2 diPAP in M. galloprovincialis was proposed on the basis of the results obtained in the present study and previous studies. These findings improve our understanding of the accumulation of perfluorocarboxylic acids in bivalve mollusks.?Environ Toxicol Chem 2021;00:1-13. ? 2021 SETAC}

Other parameters were affected differently: hatching rate was reduced only by deltamethrin (from 0.8 μg/liter); lindane caused a decrease in growth (40 μg/liter) but had no effect on the other parameters. Atrazine increased the number of deformations and edema (1300 μg/liter) but did not influence hatching rate and growth. The sensitivity of the early life stages to the pesticides was compared with acute toxicity data (LC50) of adult zebrafish. The early life stages were less sensitive to lindane (118 versus 75 μg/liter). whereas in the case of atrazine (1300 versus 37,000 μg/liter) and deltamethrin (0.5 versus 2 μg/liter; 0.5 μg/liter was the lowest concentration tested) larvae were more sensitive.}

However, the biotransformation of IMI and the toxicity of its metabolites to aquatic arthropods are largely unknown, especially the mechanisms driving species sensitivity differences and time-cumulative toxicity effects. To assess the potential effects of the metabolization of IMI and the toxicokinetics and toxicity of the metabolite(s) on aquatic arthropods, we first studied the acute toxicity of IMI and relevant metabolites to the mayfly species Cloen dipterum (sensitive to IMI) and the amphipod species Gammarus pulex (less sensitive to IMI). Secondly, toxicokinetic experiments were conducted using both the parent compound and imidacloprid-olefin (IMI-ole), a metabolite assessed as toxic in the acute tests and defined as bioactive. Of the four tested metabolites, only IMI-ole was readily biotransformed from the parent IMI and showed similar toxicity to C. dipterum as IMI. However, C. dipterum was hardly able to eliminate IMI-ole from its body. For G. pulex, IMI-ole was also the only detected metabolite causing toxicity, but the biotransformation of IMI to IMI-ole was slower and lower in G. pulex compared to C. dipterum, and G. pulex eliminated IMI-ole quicker than C. dipterum. Our results on internal kinetics of IMI and IMI-ole, and on biotransformation of IMI indicated that the metabolite IMI-ole was toxic and was rather persistent inside the body tissue of both invertebrate species, especially for C. dipterum. In conclusion, as IMI and IMI-ole have similar toxicity and IMI was replaced rapidly by IMI-ole which in turn was poorly eliminated by C. dipterum, the overall toxicity is a function of dose and time. As a result, no long-term threshold of effects of IMI may exist for C. dipterum as the poor elimination results in an ongoing increase of toxicity over time for mayflies as also found experimentally in previous published papers.}

The PAHs studied were naphthalene (NPH or C0-NPH), phenanthrene (PHE or C0-PHE), pyrene (PYR), 2-methylnaphthalene (C1-NPH), 1,3-dimethylnaphthalene (C2-NPH), 2-isopropylnaphthalene (C3-NPH), 9-methylphenanthrene (C1-PHE), and 9-ethylphenanthrene (C2-PHE). Uptake rate constants (k1) for NPHs increased with increasing degree of alkylation and log value of the octanol/water partition coefficient (Kow), whereas k1 values for three- and four-ring PAHs were lower despite their high log Kow values. Elimination rate constants (k2) for the homologue series of NPHs and PHEs generally increased with decreasing degree of alkylation and log Kow values. However, the depuration time did not directly correlate with the molecular size for nonalkylated PAHs. Bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were estimated from the ratio of k1 to k2 and also directly from PAH concentrations in fish tissue and water samples, and the factors generated by the two methods were very similar. A significant positive correlation was determined between log BCFs and log Kow values for the series of C0- through C3-NPH at both low (r2 = 0.985, p = 0.0077) and high (r2 = 0.956, p = 0.022) exposures, although this correlation was not determined for all the PAHs studied. As a result of increased metabolism and/or reduced bioavailability with increasing lipophilic character, the estimated BCFs for C0- through C2-PHE and PYR were generally lower than those for C0- through C3-NPH. The two exposure levels revealed minor variations in k1 and k2 values for parent PAHs and in the temporal pattern of PAH metabolite concentrations in bile. The present results indicate that the presence and nature of alkyl groups have a significant influence on the kinetics and metabolism of PAHs in fish.},

abstract = {Abstract The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on Enchytraeus crypticus, applying a combined toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics approach to understand the relationship between survival and the development of internal Ag concentrations in the animals over time. Toxicity tests were conducted in medium composed of well-defined aqueous solutions added to inert quartz sand to avoid the complexity of soil conditions. Citrate-coated AgNPs (AgNP-Cit) and polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated AgNPs (AgNP-PVP) were tested and compared with silver nitrate (AgNO3), which was used as a positive control for Ag ion effects. The median lethal concentration (LC50) values based on Ag concentrations in the solution phase of the test medium decreased over time and reached steady state after 7 d, with AgNO3 and AgNP-PVP being more toxic than AgNP-Cit. Slow dissolution may explain the low uptake kinetics and lower toxicity of AgNP-Cit compared with the other 2 Ag forms. The LC50 values based on internal Ag concentrations in the animals were almost stable over time, highlighting the importance of integrating toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics and relating survival with internal Ag concentrations. Neither survival-based elimination rates nor internal LC50s in the organisms showed any significant evidence of nano-specific effects for both AgNPs, although they suggested some uptake of particulate Ag for AgNP-Cit. The authors conclude that the toxicity of both types of AgNP probably is mainly attributable to the release of Ag ions. Environ Toxicol Chem 2015;34:2816–2823. © 2015 SETAC},

The best fitting was provided by a simple pseudo monocompartmental first-order kinetics model, regulated by two rates, with a pseudo first-order dissipation half-life of 230 days, accounting for real elimination as well as binding of PFOS to non-exchangeable structures. The calculated assimilation efficiency was 0.66 with confidence intervals of 0.64 and 0.68. The model calculations confirmed that the measured maximum concentrations were still far from the steady state situation, which for this dose regime, was estimated at a value of about 65μg PFOS/L serum achieved after a theoretical 210 weeks continuous exposure. The results confirm a very different kinetics than that observed in single-dose experiments confirming clear dose-related differences in apparent elimination rates in birds, as described for humans and monkeys; suggesting that a capacity-limited saturable process should also be considered in the kinetic behavior of PFOS in birds. Pseudo first-order kinetic models are highly convenient and frequently used for predicting bioaccumulation of chemicals in livestock and wildlife; the study suggests that previous bioaccumulation models using half-lives obtained at high doses are expected to underestimate the biomagnification potential of PFOS. The toxicokinetic parameters presented here can be used for higher-tier bioaccumulation estimations of PFOS in chickens and as surrogate values for modeling PFOS kinetics in wild bird species.}

abstract = {If an organism does not feed, it dies of starvation. Even though some insecticides which are used to control pests in agriculture can interfere with feeding behavior of insects and other invertebrates, the link from chemical exposure via affected feeding activity to impaired life history traits, such as survival, has not received much attention in ecotoxicology. One of these insecticides is the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, a neurotoxic substance acting specifically on the insect nervous system. We show that imidacloprid has the potential to indirectly cause lethality in aquatic invertebrate populations at low, sublethal concentrations by impairing movements and thus feeding. We investigated feeding activity, lipid content, immobility, and survival of the aquatic arthropod Gammarus pulex under exposure to imidacloprid. We performed experiments with 14 and 21 days duration, both including two treatments with two high, one day pulses of imidacloprid and one treatment with a low, constant concentration. Feeding of G. pulex as well as lipid content were significantly reduced under exposure to the low, constant imidacloprid concentration (15 $\mu$g/L). Organisms were not able to move and feed - and this caused high mortality after 14 days of constant exposure. In contrast, feeding and lipid content were not affected by repeated imidacloprid pulses. In these treatments, animals were mostly immobilized during the chemical pulses but did recover relatively fast after transfer to clean water. We also performed a starvation experiment without exposure to imidacloprid which showed that starvation alone does not explain the mortality in the constant imidacloprid exposure. Using a multiple stressor toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic modeling approach, we showed that both starvation and other toxic effects of imidacloprid play a role for determining mortality in constant exposure to the insecticide. {\textcopyright} 2013 Nyman et al.},

abstract = {Toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD) models quantify the time-course of internal concentration, which is defined by uptake, elimination and biotransformation (TK), and the processes which lead to the toxic effects (TD). TKTD models show potential in predicting pesticide effects in fluctuating concentrations, but the data requirements and validity of underlying model assumptions are not known. We calibrated TKTD models to predict survival of Gammarus pulex in propiconazole exposure and investigated the data requirements. In order to assess the need of TK in survival models, we included or excluded simulated internal concentrations based on pre-calibrated TK. Adding TK did not improve goodness of fits. Moreover, different types of calibration data could be used to model survival, which might affect model parameterization. We used two types of data for calibration: acute toxicity (standard LC50, 4 d) or pulsed toxicity data (total length 10 d). The calibration data set influenced how well the survival in the other exposure scenario was predicted (acute to pulsed scenario or vice versa). We also tested two contrasting assumptions in ecotoxicology: stochastic death and individual tolerance distribution. Neither assumption fitted to data better than the other. We observed in 10-d toxicity experiments that pulsed treatments killed more organisms than treatments with constant concentration. All treatments received the same dose, i.e. the time-weighted average concentration was equal. We studied mode of toxic action of propiconazole and it likely acts as a baseline toxicant in G. pulex during 10-days of exposure for the endpoint survival.},

abstract = {The influence of temperature on the bioaccumulation, toxicokinetics, biotransformation and depuration of pyrene was studied in the arctic marine amphipod Gammarus setosus. A two-compartment model was used to fit experimental values of total body burden, total metabolites and parent pyrene concentrations and to calculate toxicokinetic variables derived for two experimental treatments (2 and 8 °C). No statistically significant differences were observed with temperature for these toxicokinetic variables or bioconcentration factors. Contrarily, the Q10 values suggested that the toxicokinetic variables ke and km were temperature-dependent. This may be explained by the high standard deviation of the Q10 values. Q10 is the variation in the rate of a metabolic reaction with a 10 °C increase in temperature. Depuration rate constants were calculated from linear best fit equations applied to measured pyrene concentrations over time during the depuration phase of the experiment. During depuration, the parent pyrene was eliminated in two stages with faster elimination observed at 8 °C compared to 2 °C. This finding was also indicated by the Q10. No changes in total body burdens of metabolite concentrations were observed during the monitoring of depuration over a period of 96 h. The biotransformation pathway of pyrene in G. setosus was also investigated in this study with two main phase II biotransformation products discovered by liquid chromatography. These products are conditionally identified as the sulphate and glucose conjugates of 1-hydroxy-pyrene. Overall, the study contributes new knowledge to the understanding of the fate of PAHs in arctic biota. In particular, the study provides valuable insight into the bioaccumulation and biotransformation of an important PAH and its metabolites in a species that serves as both a predator and prey in the arctic ecosystem.}

Chlorpyrifos showed stronger bioaccumulation than the less lipophilic atrazine, the biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) being 6.2–99 for the former and 1.9–5.3 for the latter. While bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) dropped with increasing organic content of the sediments, the high level and considerable range of the obtained BSAFs indicate other sediment qualities, such as the age and characteristics of the organic material, having a strong effect on the bioavailability of these compounds. The slow and incomplete desorption of chlorpyrifos from the most inorganic sediment indicates also that this compound may be strongly bound to some type of inorganic material. Any specific influential sediment fraction or characteristic could not be identified.}

ABSTRACT = {The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of the most common antidepressants on aquatic protozoa. Spirostomum ambiguum was used as the model protozoan. The biological activity of four antidepressants, namely fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, and mianserin, toward S. ambiguum was evaluated. Sertraline was found to be the most toxic drug with EC50 values of 0.2 to 0.7 mg/L. The toxicity of the antidepressants depended on the pH of the medium and was the highest in alkaline conditions. Sertraline was also the most bioaccumulating compound tested, followed by mianserin. Slow depuration was observed after transferring the protozoa from the drug solutions to a fresh medium, which indicated possible lysosomotropism of the tested antidepressants in the protozoa. The biotransformation products were identified using a high-resolution mass spectrometer after two days of incubation of the protozoa with the tested antidepressants. Four to six potential biotransformation products were observed in the aqueous phase, while no metabolites were detected in the protozoan cells. Because of the low abundance of metabolites in the medium, their structure was not determined.},

abstract = {The brominated flame retardants hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants, widely distributed in aquatic systems including the marine environment and marine organisms. HBCDs are toxic to the development of both freshwater and marine fish. However, the impacts of HBCDs on marine invertebrates are not well known. In this study, the marine copepod, Tigriopus japonicus, was used to assess the bioaccumulation and developmental toxicity of technical HBCD (tHBCD) through water-borne exposure. The uptake rate constant of tHBCD by T. japonicus was high, which resulted in high bioaccumulation potential. The bioconcentration factors of tHBCD were 8.73 × 104 and 6.34 × 104 L kg−1 in T. japonicus, calculated using the kinetic and steady-state methods, respectively. Exposure of T. japonicus nauplii to tHBCD caused significant growth delay. The lowest-observable-effect-concentrations of tHBCD induced developmental delay were 30 and 8 μg L−1 for the F0 and F1 generations, respectively, which suggested that the F1 generation was more sensitive to tHBCD than the F0 generation and warranted multiple-generation toxicity tests for future studies. Furthermore, exposure of the adult copepods to tHBCD induced the transcription of oxidative stress response genes and apoptotic genes, e.g., SOD,CAT, GST, OGG1, P53 and Caspase-3. It was therefore speculated that tHBCD exposure induced the generation of reactive oxygen species in T. japonicus, which activated the oxidative stress defense genes and meanwhile resulted in oxidative DNA damage. The damaged DNA activated the transcription of p53 and triggered the caspase-mediated apoptosis pathway, which may be the reason for the tHBCD induced developmental delay in T. japonicus nauplii.}

The total amount of 6:2 diPAP accumulated in the skin was the highest due to its high mass content. These results indicated that skin absorption and gut processes were two major pathways for earthworms to accumulate 6:2 diPAP from soil. In vitro desorption experiments indicated that the gut digestion fluid greatly promoted the desorption of 6:2 diPAP from the soil and enhanced its bioavailability. Degradation of 6:2 diPAP in the soil was stimulated when the earthworm appeared. In contrast to the soil, a more extensive transformation occurred in the earthworm. Perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) was the primary phase Ⅰ product, followed by perfluoropentyl propanoic acid (FPePA), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), 2-perfluorohexyl ethanoic acid (FHEA), and perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), which confirmed the occurrence of α- and β-oxidation in earthworms. For the first time, a new phase II product, namely, a 6:2 fluorotelomer alcohol sulfate conjugate, was identified in earthworms at unexpectedly high levels, which might be the primary way earthworms eliminate 6:2 diPAP. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments suggested that 6:2 diPAP experienced faster and more extensive biotransformation in the gut than in the organs. This work sheds light on the bioaccumulation and biotransformation of 6:2 diPAP in terrestrial invertebrates, providing strong evidence of indirect sources of PFCAs in the environment.}

abstract = {Abstract Nanopesticides are novel plant protection products offering numerous benefits. Because nanoparticles behave differently from dissolved chemicals, the environmental risks of these materials could differ from conventional pesticides. We used soil–earthworm systems to compare the fate and uptake of analytical-grade bifenthrin to that of bifenthrin in traditional and nanoencapsulated formulations. Apparent sorption coefficients for bifenthrin were up to 3.8 times lower in the nano treatments than in the non-nano treatments, whereas dissipation half-lives of the nano treatments were up to 2 times longer. Earthworms in the nano treatments accumulated approximately 50\% more bifenthrin than those in the non-nano treatments. In the non-nano treatments, most of the accumulated material was found in the earthworm tissue, whereas in the nano treatments, the majority resided in the gut. Evaluation of toxicokinetic modeling approaches showed that models incorporating the release rate of bifenthrin from the nanocapsule and distribution within the earthworm provided the best estimations of uptake from the nano-formulations. Overall, our findings indicate that the risks of nanopesticides may be different from those of conventional formulations. The modeling presented provides a starting point for assessing risks of these materials but needs to be further developed to better consider the behavior of the nanoencapsulated pesticide within the gut system.

abstract = {Abstract Recent advances in modeling the processes of the toxicity of chemicals—toxicokinetics (TK) and toxicodynamics (TD)—are improving environmental risk assessment (ERA) through prediction of effects from time-varying exposure. This has been achieved by linking chemical fate and toxicological effects mechanistically, based on internal concentrations, through the tissue residue approach. However, certain questions remain: for example, how do TK and TD differ among species and how does this relate to differences in species sensitivity? In a series of experiments, we studied the TK of [14C]chlorpyrifos in 15 freshwater arthropod species, two of which were studied in juvenile and adult life stages. Uptake (kin) and elimination (kout) rate constants were fitted using a one-compartment single first-order kinetic model. The application of two complementary parameter estimation methods facilitated the calculation of bioconcentration factors (BCF) with prediction intervals and 95\% depuration times (t95) for all tested species. Extremely slow elimination was observed in some species as well as high overall variation in kin, kout, BCF, and t95 across the tested aquatic arthropod species. This variation has implications for the development of TKTD approaches in ERA, including assessing fluctuating exposure concentrations and the interpretation of observed toxicity responses in the laboratory and in the field.

abstract = {The importance of incorporating kinetic approaches in order to gain information on underlying physiological processes explaining species sensitivity to environmental stressors has been highlighted in recent years. Uranium is present in the aquatic environment worldwide due to naturally occurring and anthropogenic sources, posing a potential risk to freshwater taxa in contaminated areas. Although literature shows that organisms vary widely with respect to susceptibility to U, information on toxicokinetics that may explain the variation in toxicodynamic responses is scarce. In the present work, Daphnia magna were exposed to a range of environmentally relevant U concentrations (0 – 200 µg L−1) followed by a 48 h depuration phase to obtain information on toxicokinetic parameters and toxic responses. Results showed time-dependent and concentration-dependent uptake of U in daphnia (ku = 1.2 – 3.8 L g−1 day−1) with bioconcentration factors (BCFs) ranging from 1,641 – 5,204 (L kg−1), a high depuration rate constant (ke = 0.75 day−1), the majority of U tightly bound to the exoskeleton (~ 50 – 60%) and maternal transfer of U (1 – 7%). Effects on growth, survivorship and major ion homeostasis strongly correlated with exposure (external or internal) and toxicokinetic parameters (uptake rates, ku, BCF), indicating that uptake and internalization drives U toxicity responses in D. magna. Interference from U with ion uptake pathways and homeostasis was highlighted by the alteration in whole-body ion concentrations, their ionic ratios (e.g., Ca:Mg and Na:K) and the increased expression in some ion regulating genes. Together, this work adds to the limited data examining U kinetics in freshwater taxa and, in addition, provides perspective on factors influencing stress, toxicity and adaptive response to environmental contaminants such as uranium.}

One and multi-compartments toxicokinetic (TK) models are powerful tools to formalize and predict how a contaminant is bioaccumulated. The aim of this study is to develop modeling approaches to improve knowledge on dynamic of accumulation and fate of Cd and Hg in gammarid’s organs. Gammarids were exposed to dissolved metals (11.1 ± 1.2 µg.L−1 of Cd or 0.27 ± 0.13 µg.L−1 of Hg) before a depuration phase. At each sampling days, their organs (caeca, cephalon, intestine and remaining tissues) were separated by dissection before analyses. Results allowed us to determine that i) G.fossarum takes up Cd as efficiently as the mussel M.galloprovincialis, but eliminates it more rapidly, ii) organs which accumulate and depurate the most, in terms of concentrations, are caeca and intestine for both metals; iii) the one-compartment TK models is the most relevant for Hg, while the multi-compartments TK model allows a better fit to Cd data, demonstrating dynamic transfer of Cd among organs.}

abstract = {Metal pollution e.g. copper, in water bodies occurs worldwide. Although copper is an essential trace metal, at certain levels it is still considered as pollutant. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of exposure concentration on copper bioaccumulation in marbled crayfish (Procambarus sp.) by determining uptake and elimination kinetics. Crayfish were exposed to sub-lethal copper concentrations (average measured concentrations of 0.031 and 0.38mgCuL−1) for 14d and transferred to copper-free water for another 14d. At different time points during the uptake and elimination phases copper concentrations were measured in five organs (exoskeleton, gills, muscle, ovaries and hepatopancreas). At 0.031mgCuL−1, copper levels in the crayfish organs were not significantly increased compared to the control animals, suggesting effective regulation. Exposure to 0.38mgCuL−1 did lead to not significantly increased copper levels in muscles and ovaries, while the gills and exoskeleton, which are in direct contact with the water, showed significantly higher copper concentrations. In these four organs, copper showed fast uptake kinetics with equilibrium reached within 10d of exposure. Copper accumulation was highest in the hepatopancreas; uptake in this storage organ steadily increased with time and did not reach equilibrium within the 14-d exposure period. Copper accumulation levels in the marbled crayfish found in this study were hepatopancreas>gills>exoskeleton>muscle.}
